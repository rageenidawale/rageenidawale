## Hi, I'm Rageeni 👋

I’m a Python developer working mainly with **Django** and **Flask**.  
I’m focused on learning by building small, practical projects and gradually improving my backend fundamentals.

I enjoy working on web apps, Chrome extensions, and experimenting with ideas to understand how things work end-to-end.
